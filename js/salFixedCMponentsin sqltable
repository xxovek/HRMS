CTC = Gross Salary + PF + Gratuity

 
Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + Other Allowances

Net Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + Allowances - Income Tax - Employer's Provident Fund - Professional Tax

Provident fund contribution is mandatorily either of the following:
Case 1: Basic salary < 15000 (per month)
12% of the basic salary

Case2: Basic salary > 15000 (per month)
In this case the company has an option to either contribute 12% of 15,000 (i.e. 1800) or 12% of Basic salary.

Gross Salary = CTC – (EPF + Gratuity)

Taxable Income = Income (Gross Salary + other income) – Deductions
